Bill of Materials for a Prop Dropper:
---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- 
1 - Metal gear servo motor, model SG996
1 - Metal gear continuous rotation servo motor, model SG995
1 - 4-pin ulrasonic range finder ("ping sensor"), model HC-SR04
1 - Arduino Uno R3 or Nano.  Others will work but these are the most practical for this project.
1 - Circuit board or breadboard for wiring.
1 - 0.1" pin header.  Can be 1x6 or larger.
Hot glue or epoxy (recommend 5-minute clear Permatex Permapoxy).
Plastic zip ties / wire ties
A quantity of hookup wire or breadboard jumper wire.
A length of CAT-5 or CAT-6 (or any 6-conductor) wire to run between the prop and its controller, if the conroller is remote.  
  You'll need 6 conductors (Vcc, Grnd, servo signal1, servo signal2, pingTrigger, pingEcho).
  It's best to use an Arduino Nano and integrate the electronics into the prop so it only needs power. 
  In that case, you can forego the 6 conductor wire and use a 2-conductor power line.
3D-printing services (optional)
